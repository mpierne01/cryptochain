# cryptochain


## The Block Chain Backend
- Create the Block Class with tests - Constructor
- Create Genesis block tests
- Genesis block to pass/function - Factory
- Mine Blocks tests
- Mine Block to pass/function
- Crypto Hash and SHA-256 tests
- Crypto Hash and SHA-256 to pass/function
- Hash in Mine block tests + functional code

## The Chain
- block chain tests
- block chain to pass/function
- chain validation tests
- chain validation to pass/function
- chain replacement
- adding stubs to the tests jest mock and error mineBlock

# Proof of work
- difficulty and the nonce tests
- difficulty and nonce pass/function
- adding dynamic difficulty and mine rate tests
- adding dynamic difficulty and mine rate pass/function
- adjust the difficulty in the mine block tests
- adjust the difficulty in the mine block pass/function
